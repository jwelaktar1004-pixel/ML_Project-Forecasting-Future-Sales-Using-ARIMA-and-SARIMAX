# ML_Project-Forecasting-Future-Sales-Using-ARIMA-and-SARIMAX

# 📈 Sales Forecasting Using ARIMA & SARIMAX

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting future sales using classical time series models in Python. ARIMA and SARIMAX models were implemented to analyze historical sales data, capture trend and seasonality, and generate accurate future forecasts for business decision-making.

## 🎯 Objective
- Forecast future sales based on historical data
- Identify trends and seasonal patterns
- Support demand planning and business strategy

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Statsmodels (ARIMA, SARIMAX)
- from pandas  import DateOffset
- from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Stationarity check and differencing  
4. Train-test split  
5. ARIMA model development  
6. SARIMAX model development  
7. Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE)  
8. Future sales forecasting  
9. Visualization and insights  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Sales data shows clear trend and seasonality
- SARIMAX performed better for seasonal patterns
- Forecasts help in short- to mid-term planning

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of time series forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMAX, providing actionable insights for business stakeholders.
